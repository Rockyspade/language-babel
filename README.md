# language-babel

This fork exists only for the purpose of locking the version to `v2.22.0` in [Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist).
For syntax highlighting in Atom, you should use [gandm/language-babel](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel).

The last versions of language-babel are incompatible with GitHub's regular expression engine (PCRE vs. Oniguruma for Atom).
For more context, see [github/linguist#3044](https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3044).
